*(Visit the Interior of the Earth, by Rectifying you will find the Hidden Stone)*

## Why VITRIOL?

VITRIOL is my attempt at using every optimization possible to run modern AI models on old hardware that would have no business running them otherwise. I am talking here specifically about my old desktop PC with a narrow PCIe bus, an outdated GPU, a CPU without AVX2 instructions, so offloading isn't even practical. With those constraints in mind I had a simple question: Could I stream directly from system RAM to GPU. It took a while, but I managed through a solid direct memory access system and a custom copy engine. Every optimization I am doing now is really one big mad computer science experiment to make old hardware punch above its weight, and possibly introduce those optimizations for newer hardware. This means VITRIOL is not a stable repo in the slighest. Not yet at least. I am trying to use the latest papers and research on LLM inference to squeeze every bit of performance out of my silicon, and I hope this comes to your benefit as well.

Regarding the name, in alchemy, vitriol was considered the ultimate catalyst for transmuting matter. This is something this application aims to do as well. To transform old hardware into a high performant AI transformer. Lead into gold. You know the drill. Aditionally, around the 15th century, the esoteric backcronym was formed: *"Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem"*. In a way, this is what we are doing. We are reaching down into the bowels of the computer, rectifying the data streams, and running inference on our newfound philosopher's stone. Yes, I know how incredibly silly this all sounds, but it makes me happy to be using archaic alchemical terminology. Regarding the logo: In alchemical texts and artwork, vitriol was often depicted as a "Green Lion devouring the Sun". This is a metaphor for sulfuric acid dissolving base metals (symbolically represented by the green lion) to extract and purify precious gold (the alchemical symbol for which is the sun).

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone with submodule (llama.cpp is pinned)
git clone --recursive https://github.com/your/vitriol.git
# Or if already cloned: git submodule update --init --recursive

# 2. Build
cd vitriol/llama.cpp && cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_NATIVE=ON \
  && cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# 3. One-time capability grant
./vitriol setup

# 4. Configure
./vitriol config

# 5. Run
./vitriol run
```


## Configuration

VITRIOL has several feature flags that control memory, context efficiency, and retrieval. Each has measurable trade-offs between throughput, context size, and recall quality.

| Flag | Effect | tok/s impact | Use Case |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| `--spec-type mtp` / `--spec-draft-n-max 2` | MTP speculative decoding (+20% gen) | +20% | Max throughput (requires MTP-capable model) |
| `--chimera-mode auto` | Dual-backend: CUDA for MoE, Vulkan for dense ops | **+80%** | Auto-detected when both backends available |
| `--cache-type-k q4_0` | K cache quantized to 4-bit | Required at 256K | Reduces host KV. V cache stays f16 — **do not use `--cache-type-v`** |
| `--kv-quant-v f16` | V cache precision (default f16) | — | **f16 only** — q8_0/q4_0 corrupt output with VITRIOL |
| `--pin-layers N` | Pin first N layers' expert tensors in VRAM | +5-10% | Covers early MoE layers in VRAM (default 8) |
| `--kv-mode offload` | KV cache in host RAM | Enables 256K context | Long context coding |
| `--kv-mode sparse` | Attention-score eviction (4-8x compression) | Saves host RAM | Extreme context length |
| `--frozen-prompt on` | Cache KV prefix across requests | Prefill saved | Repeated requests, same system prompt |
| `--memory-mode on` | Cross-session persistent memory via SQLite | ~5.0 | Multi-session projects |
| `--semantic-mode on` | Cosine similarity retrieval | ~5.0 | Large memory databases |
| `--disk-offload` | File-backed mmap for models > system RAM | — | Large models (e.g., 24 GB Coder-Next) |

All flags can be set via CLI flag, env var, or the TUI (`vitriol config`).

## What Is It

VITRIOL is a **VRAM extension layer** for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) that lets **old consumer GPUs** run modern MoE language models they have no business running.

The problem: the best open-weight models are MoE architectures (Mixture of Experts) with 200+ expert weight matrices. A Qwen3.6-35B-A3B needs ~12 GB VRAM for weights alone. A GTX 1070 Ti has 8 GB. An RTX 3060 has 12. A GTX 960 has 2. These GPUs are in millions of machines — perfectly capable of fast matrix math, but VRAM-starved.

VITRIOL's insight: MoE models only activate ~2-8 out of 256 experts per token. The expert weights don't need to live in VRAM. Keep them in **page-locked system RAM** instead — the GPU reads them over PCIe DMA on demand. The base model, attention weights, KV cache, and compute buffers stay in VRAM. Only the experts are offloaded.

**Result:** 23.3 tok/s on a GTX 1070 Ti (8 GB) with a Qwen3.6-35B MoE model via the Chimera dual-backend (CUDA+Vulkan) — **+309% vs the pre-VITRIOL x8 baseline** (5.7 tok/s). The model doesn't fit at all without VITRIOL.

| GPU | GTX 1070 Ti (Pascal, 8 GB VRAM, PCIe Gen3 x16) |

| System RAM used | ~10 GiB (VITRIOL buffer + KV cache) |
| VRAM used | ~2.5 GiB (model + KV cache + compute buffers) |


## How It Works

### The Trick: Making CUDA Think Host Memory Is Fine

CUDA kernels can read from **page-locked host memory** over PCIe DMA transparently — the GPU's memory controller handles the cross-PCIe access as if it were VRAM, just slower (~12 GB/s PCIe 3.0 vs ~256 GB/s GDDR5). llama.cpp normally avoids this because it's bandwidth-inefficient. But for MoE experts — where each matmul uses only 2-8 of 256 experts per layer — the effective bandwidth needed is low enough that PCIe latency is acceptable.

VITRIOL implements this through a custom **ggml backend buffer type**:

```
VITRIOL buffer type (CUDA experts)
  │
  ├─ 1. Allocation
  │     mmap(10 GB anonymous)         ← reserve address space
  │     madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE)        ← hint for 2 MB pages (lower GPU TLB pressure)
  │     mlock                         ← pin to RAM, prevent swapping
  │     cudaHostRegister              ← register with CUDA for DMA access
  │
  ├─ 2. Model load
  │     memcpy from GGUF file → VITRIOL buffer (one-time 10 GB copy, ~64 s)
  │
  └─ 3. Inference
        Set is_host=true on the buffer type → llama.cpp scheduler routes
        MUL_MAT_ID to CUDA backend → GPU reads expert weights over PCIe DMA

VITRIOL VK buffer type (Vulkan dense ops, Chimera only)
  │
  ├─ 1. Allocation
  │     posix_memalign(64K alignment)  ← aligned for VK_EXT_external_memory_host
  │     mlock                         ← pin to RAM
  │
  └─ 2. Inference
        VkBuffer created lazily via ggml_vk_buffer_from_host_ptr()
        → Vulkan reads dense tensor weights over PCIe DMA (zero-copy)
```

The key flag is **`is_host=true`**. When the graph scheduler sees this on a buffer type it supports (via `supports_buft`), it treats the tensor as host-resident and keeps it in system memory. The CUDA backend accesses `src0->data` directly — the GPU's DMA engine fetches the bytes over PCIe when the kernel reads from that address.

### Chimera Dual-Backend (CUDA + Vulkan)

The Chimera hybrid backend routes each operation to the optimal GPU backend:

| Operation | Backend | Why |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| MoE expert matmuls (`MUL_MAT_ID`) | CUDA VITRIOL | Page-locked DMA + pin pool + predictor |
| SSM scan (d_state=16) | Vulkan | Pre-baked command buffers, Mamba-1 shader |
| SSM scan (d_state=128/256) | Vulkan | Already supported |
| Attention (KQ, PV) | Vulkan | Pre-baked pipelines |
| Dense matmuls | Vulkan | Pre-baked pipelines |

**Architecture:**
```
                    Page-locked Host RAM
                    ┌──────────────────────┐
                    │ Expert weights       │ Dense weights        │
                    │ (CUDA VITRIOL type)  │ (VITRIOL VK type)    │
                    └──────────────────────┘
                               │                    │
                    CUDA: cudaHostRegister    VK: VK_EXT_external_memory_host
                    reads via PCIe DMA        reads via imported VkBuffer

Activations: CUDA VRAM ←→ CPU staging ←→ Vulkan VRAM
             (~0.001ms per 16KB copy, ~0.13% overhead per token)
```

**Auto-detect:** Set `VITRIOL_CHIMERA_MODE=auto` (default). The model loader
automatically detects if the Vulkan backend is available via dlsym. If both
CUDA and Vulkan are present, Chimera activates. No manual config needed.

**Modes:**
| Mode | Effect |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | Chimera if both backends available, CUDA-only otherwise |
| `cuda` | CUDA-only (standard VITRIOL, no Vulkan) |
| `vulkan` | Vulkan-only (all tensors via VK_EXT_external_memory_host) |
| `off` | CUDA-only (same as cuda) |

### Fast Path vs Slow Path (CUDA)

llama.cpp's `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_id` has three paths for MoE matmuls:

| Path | Trigger | Expert Data Access | VITRIOL? |
|------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **MMVQ** | Batch ≤ 8, quantized weights | Reads `src0->data` directly with expert bounds | Yes — host DMA |
| **MMQ** | Large batch, quantized | Reads `src0->data` directly with expert bounds | Yes — host DMA |
| **cuBLAS (slow path)** | Everything else | Per-expert tensor slices | No — FP16 only |

For quantized models, the MMQ/MMVQ fast paths handle all MoE inference on CUDA.
Dense ops (SSM, attention) run on Vulkan with pre-baked command buffers when
Chimera mode is active.

### Why Not Just Load Everything Into VRAM?

Because it doesn't fit. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B at IQ2_M is ~3.5 GB. The GTX 1070 Ti has 8 GiB total.
Without VITRIOL, llama.cpp crashes with `cudaMalloc failed: out of memory` at `-ngl 99`.

With VITRIOL (Chimera mode):
- Base model weights (dense, non-expert): ~1.3 GiB in VRAM
- Expert weights: 0 GiB in VRAM (host RAM only, CUDA DMA)
- Dense weights: 0 GiB in VRAM (host RAM only, Vulkan VK_EXT)
- KV cache + compute: ~28 MiB (8K ctx K q4_0) + ~304 MiB (compute buffers)
- MTP head (optional): +302 MiB in VRAM
- Pin pool (optional): +0-4096 MiB in VRAM (expert tensors cached in VRAM)
- **Total VRAM: ~1.6 GiB (MTP, no pin pool) / ~5.7 GiB (MTP + pin 8)**

## VITRIOL Modes

| Mode | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **stream** | **(Default.)** RAM Shot + VITRIOL DMA. All expert weights in page-locked host RAM. GPU reads them over PCIe DMA on demand. MTP head (if enabled) loads through the same buffer. |
| **Chimera** | **(Auto-detect, VITRIOL_CHIMERA_MODE=auto.)** Dual-backend hybrid. Expert tensors → CUDA VITRIOL DMA (page-locked host RAM). Dense tensors (SSM, attention, norms) → Vulkan via `VK_EXT_external_memory_host`. Cross-backend activation copies handled automatically by the scheduler (~0.13% overhead). 23.3 tok/s verified. |

### Memory Mode (Experimental)

When enabled (`--memory-mode on` or `VITRIOL_MEMORY_MODE=on`), a Python Flask shim intercepts all requests before they reach llama-server. On each request:

1. **Extract** user intent from the last message
2. **Retrieve** relevant context from a project-local SQLite memory database (episodic + semantic scoring with cascading multi-hop retrieval)
3. **Inject** retrieved context as a system message, staying within a token budget
4. **Forward** the compact prompt to llama-server
5. **Store** the response back into the memory database
6. **Update** Hebbian edge weights (post-response connection strengthening)

Ports swap automatically: llama-server moves to `PORT-1` (8278), the shim listens on `PORT` (8279). OpenCode's baseURL never changes.

```
Memory OFF:  llama-server → port 8279
Memory ON:   llama-server → port 8278, shim → port 8279
```

Configure via `vitriol config` (TUI option 4) or `vitriol serve --memory-mode on`.

## Performance

### Current Best: 23.3 tok/s (Server, Verified Clean, Chimera Dual-Backend)

System: GTX 1070 Ti (PCIe Gen3 x16), 15 GB RAM, IQ2_M model, Chimera dual-backend
(CUDA VITRIOL for MoE + Vulkan for dense ops), MTP N=2, pin=8, `--cache-type-k q4_0`.

| Config | Gen (tok/s) | vs x8 baseline | Notes |
|--------|------------|----------------|-------|
| PCIe x8 (GTX 960 present, no VITRIOL) | 5.7 | — | Pre-VITRIOL baseline |
| PCIe x16 (GTX 960 removed) | 8.9 | +56% | Before MTP/pin/Chimera |
| + Q2_K_XL + pin 15 | 9.88 | +73% | ✅ Clean (no MTP) |
| + IQ2_M + MTP N=2 + pin 8 | 12.82 | +125% | ✅ Clean (2026-05-21) |
| **+ Chimera + CAP_IPC_LOCK** | **23.3** | **+309%** | ✅ Clean (2026-05-22) |

**Key findings:**
- **Best config:** IQ2_M model with Chimera dual-backend, `--spec-type mtp --spec-draft-n-max 2 --cache-type-k q4_0` at **23.3 t/s** (verified clean, server-side)
- MTP acceptance rate: ~100% (19/19 drafts accepted per typical cycle at 8K context)
- Chimera auto-detects: `VITRIOL_CHIMERA_MODE=auto` enables CUDA+Vulkan hybrid automatically
- `--cache-type-v` **must remain at f16** — V cache quantization corrupts output with VITRIOL (see Experiment 17)
- Pin pool (`VITRIOL_PIN_FIRST_N_LAYERS=8`) covers first 8 expert layers in VRAM

### VRAM at 8K Context (Chimera Dual-Backend)

| GPU | VRAM | Status | Notes |
|-----|------|--------|-------|
| GTX 1070 Ti | 8 GB | ✅ Verified | PCIe 3.0 x16, **23.3 tok/s** (Chimera, IQ2_M, MTP N=2, pin=8) — confirmed 2026-05-22 |
| RTX 3060 | 12 GB | ✅ Supported | More VRAM for larger KV cache |
| RTX 4090 | 24 GB | ✅ Supported | PCIe 4.0 x16 → higher bandwidth |
| AMD RX 7000 | varies | ✅ Chimera (Vulkan) | Vulkan backend handles dense ops; MoE via CUDA not available |
| Intel Arc | varies | ✅ Chimera (Vulkan) | Vulkan backend via `VK_EXT_external_memory_host` |

**CPU requirement:** VITRIOL uses the GPU as the primary MoE compute engine (experts
streamed over PCIe DMA). The CPU is only an orchestrator — no AVX2 or fast CPU is
required. This is in contrast to CPU-based expert offloading (e.g., KTransformers),
which depends heavily on CPU vector extensions.

## Compatibility

### Tested
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 Ti (CC 6.1, 8 GB VRAM, PCIe Gen3 x16)
- **CPU:** Intel 4th gen (Haswell, no AVX2) — only orchestrates, does not compute experts
- **RAM:** 15 GB DDR3 system, NVMe SSD
- **OS:** Linux — Ubuntu 24.04, kernel 6.17+, NVIDIA driver 535.288.01, CUDA 12.2
- **Models:** Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q2_K_XL (baseline, ~2.2 bpw) / IQ2_M (MTP-capable, ~2.6 bpw)
- **llama.cpp:** Pinned submodule with VITRIOL CUDA integration
- **Context:** 128,000 tokens at K q4_0 + V f16 KV quant (`--cache-type-k q4_0`; `--cache-type-v` is forbidden — see Experiment 17)

### Likely works
- **NVIDIA GPUs with CC ≥ 5.0:** All Pascal, Turing, Ampere, Ada, Blackwell cards. The `cudaHostRegister` + PCIe DMA path is architecture-agnostic. Higher VRAM GPUs benefit from larger LRU cache or keeping more layers in VRAM.
- **NVIDIA GPUs with CC 5.x (Maxwell):** Some GPU kernel ops may be missing — set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to exclude them or use `vitriol config` to set `exclude_secondary = true`.
- **ROCm/HIP (AMD):** Would need a mechanical port of the CUDA driver API calls to HIP equivalents (`cudaHostRegister` → `hipHostRegister`, `cuMemAlloc` → `hipMalloc`, etc.). llama.cpp already has `GGML_USE_HIP` guards. Estimated ~400 lines changed across 3 files.
- **Windows (NVIDIA):** NVCC + `cudaHostRegister` works identically. Untested but no fundamental blocker. The `vitriol` CLI launcher currently uses bash — would need a PowerShell/batch wrapper.

### Likely won't work
- **Intel GPUs (SYCL/oneAPI):** SYCL doesn't expose page-locked host DMA in the same way. The unified memory model on integrated GPUs also makes VITRIOL's trick unnecessary — there's no discrete PCIe bus to cross.
- **Apple Silicon (Metal):** Unified memory architecture. CPU and GPU share the same physical RAM pool. VITRIOL provides no benefit — the entire model fits in unified memory if it fits at all.
- **Nouveau (open-source NVIDIA driver):** Lacks `cudaHostRegister` equivalent. The GMMU page tables populated by the proprietary NVIDIA RM driver are required for PCIe DMA from system memory.

## Emulated Memory Architecture (Experimental)

When **memory mode** is enabled (`--memory-mode on`), a Flask proxy shim sits between the client and llama-server. Every request is intercepted, memory is queried for relevant context, and the prompt is compacted *before* reaching the inference engine — eliminating OpenCode's expensive context compaction loop.

Ports swap transparently — OpenCode always talks to port 8279:

```
Memory OFF:  llama-server → port 8279
Memory ON:   llama-server → port 8278, shim → port 8279
```

## Ars Priori & Acknowledgements

VITRIOL stands on the shoulders of giants. Every core insight — DMA over PCIe, metapage completion signaling, async expert prefetching, extreme quantization on legacy hardware — was reverse-engineered from the following works. We document our debt explicitly.

### Inference Engine

| Project | What We Learned |
|---------|-----------------|
| **[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)** (ggml-org) | The core inference engine. GGUF format, CUDA backend, tensor loading pipeline. The `-ot` (override tensor) flag in PR #11397 was the breakthrough that enabled expert streaming. Our `vitriol-cuda-integration.cpp` hooks into `ggml-cuda.cu` at the tensor-copy boundary. Vulkan backend (PR #16463) provides SSM operation support and `VK_EXT_external_memory_host` for zero-copy host memory import. |
| **[PR #16463](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/16463)** (giuseppe) | Added SSM_SCAN and SSM_CONV to the Vulkan backend. Our Mamba-1 shader extends this with Mamba-2-only to add d_state=16 support for Qwen3's Gated Delta Net and Jamba2. |
| **[GGUF Format](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/ggml/include/gguf.h)** | Binary model format with tensor offsets accessible via `gguf_get_tensor_offset()`, `gguf_get_tensor_name()`, `gguf_get_tensor_type()` — the foundation of our expert parser. |
| **[PR #11397](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/11397)** (slaren) | Added `--override-tensor` (`-ot`) for per-tensor-type buffer placement. The exact mechanism we use: `-ot ".*exps.*=CPU"` keeps 8GB of experts on CPU while attention layers run on GPU. |
| **[PR #11571](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/11571)** (fairydreaming) | Load-all-experts-during-warmup; `llama_set_warmup()` API for ensuring all expert tensors are resident before inference. |
| **[PR #6387](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/6387)** (slaren) | Changed expert storage from per-expert tensors to a single 3D tensor — critical for our approach since all 256 experts are now in one contiguous block. |

### GPUDirect Storage & DMA

| Project | What We Learned |
|---------|-----------------|
| **[gds-nvidia-fs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gds-nvidia-fs)** (NVIDIA) | Official GPUDirect Storage source code. We studied `nvfs-core.c`, `nvfs-pci.c`, and `nvfs-dma.c` to understand: kiocb completion callbacks for NVMe, shared metapage (4KB) for fast completion signaling, `wmb()` memory barriers before DMA. |
| **[open-gpu-kernel-modules](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules)** (NVIDIA) | NVIDIA's open kernel module source for PCIe register-level operations — reference for understanding BAR mapping and GPU PCI config space. |
| **[hw-nvdla](https://github.com/NVIDIA/hw-nvdla)** (NVIDIA) | Hardware DLA documentation for understanding direct memory access patterns on NVIDIA silicon. |

### Async Scheduling & MoE Orchestration

| Project | What We Learned |
|---------|-----------------|
| **[KTransformers](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/KTransformers)** (kvcache-ai) | YAML-based layer placement across CPU/GPU, double-buffer prefetch pattern (compute layer N while streaming N+1), MoE-specific async scheduling. KTransformers targets modern CPUs (AMX/AVX512); VITRIOL inverts this — GPU as primary compute, CPU as orchestrator only. |
| **[PowerInfer](https://github.com/SJTU-IPADS/PowerInfer)** (SJTU-IPADS) | Neuron-level offloading with predictor for which neurons will fire — only loads those into GPU. Informs our predictive prefetching approach. |
| **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B MoE** | 256 experts, 8 active per token — the exact sparsity architecture that makes expert streaming viable. The MoE router (`ffn_gate_inp`) determines which 8 experts to load; only those need to be in VRAM. |
