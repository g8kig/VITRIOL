# VITRIOL Configuration Guide — Recommended Defaults

## Hardware Baseline

The recommended defaults are tuned for:

| Component | Spec |
|-----------|------|
| GPU | NVIDIA GTX 1070 Ti (8 GB VRAM, Pascal CC 6.1) |
| RAM | 15 GB |
| Storage | NVMe SSD |
| Model | Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q2_K_XL (MoE, 256 experts, 8 active/token) |

> **If your hardware differs**, see *When to Diverge* at the end of each section.

---

## 1. Operation Mode — `stream`

**Default:** `mode = stream`

### Why It Works

The model has 256 experts but only 8 are active per token. With 8 GB VRAM, we can't fit all 10 GB of expert weights on the GPU. Stream mode solves this:

```
NVMe → System RAM (10 GB VITRIOL buffer, page-locked via cudaHostRegister)
   → LRU VRAM cache (2 GB, hot experts cached)
   → GPU compute
```

- Expert weights live in page-locked system RAM
- Hot experts (frequently used) are cached in the 2 GB VRAM LRU pool
- Cold experts stream across PCIe on demand
- Non-expert layers (attention, norms) stay on GPU

**Measured throughput:** ~5.9 tok/s generation, ~66 tok/s eval (with all optimizations enabled)

### When to Diverge

| Scenario | Recommended Mode | Reason |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| You have 24+ GB VRAM | `mode = off` | All weights fit on GPU, no need for stream mode |
| < 8 GB VRAM | `mode = async` | Lower memory overhead, slower but more stable |
| You only have 8-12 GB system RAM | Use `--disk-offload` | Avoids 10 GB page-locked buffer (see Disk Offload) |

---

## 2. Frozen Prompt — `on`

**Default:** `frozen_prompt = on`

### Why It Works

The KV cache for the system prompt is computed once and reused across all turns in a conversation. Without this, every new message reprocesses the entire system prompt, wasting ~400ms on re-prefixing.

**Measured impact:**

| Metric | Without Frozen | With Frozen | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Eval speed | 43 tok/s | 66 tok/s | **+53%** |
| Gen speed | 5.63 tok/s | 5.89 tok/s | **+5%** |

This is the single highest-impact optimization in VITRIOL.

### How It Works

When `frozen_prompt = on`, the server:
1. Detects the system prompt (first message)
2. Caches its KV computation in GPU VRAM (~0.5-2 MB depending on prompt length)
3. On subsequent requests, appends new user messages to the cached KV instead of recomputing

### When to Diverge

| Scenario | Recommended | Reason |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| No system prompt used | `off` (no benefit) | No prompt to freeze |
| System prompt changes per request | `off` | Frozen KV would be stale |
| Extremely long system prompts (>8K tokens) | `off` | Frozen KV consumes too much VRAM |

## 3. Context Window — `500000`

**Default:** `context = 500000` (500K tokens)

### Why It Works

With Q4_0 KV cache quantization, each KV cell is 4 bits (0.5 bytes per element). The model architecture (40 layers, 2 KV heads, 256-dim) means each token consumes ~5.6 KB of KV cache.

| Context | KV Cache Size | Total VRAM | Headroom |
|---------|---------------|------------|----------|
| 254K | 1,396 MiB | 3,738 MiB | 4,374 MiB |
| 500K | ~2,800 MiB | ~5,100 MiB | ~3,000 MiB |
| 1,000K | ~5,600 MiB | ~8,000 MiB | ~100 MiB |

At 500K tokens, we use ~5.1 GB of VRAM (model + KV + compute), leaving 3 GB headroom for LRU cache and temporary buffers.

**VRAM budget breakdown at 500K context:**

```
GTX 1070 Ti (8,112 MiB):
  Model weights (GPU)          1,337 MiB
  KV cache (500K, Q4_0)        2,800 MiB
  Compute/RS buffers             556 MiB
  LRU VRAM cache               2,048 MiB
  ───────────────────────────────────
  Total                         6,741 MiB ← Headroom: 1,371 MiB
```

### When to Diverge

| Scenario | Recommended Context | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Short chat sessions | 32K-128K | Faster prefill, less VRAM used |
| Code generation | 8K-32K | Code rarely needs 500K context |
| Document analysis | 500K-1M | Need full document in context |
| < 8 GB VRAM | Reduce to 128K-254K | Fit within VRAM budget |

---

## 4. LRU Cache — `2048 MB`

**Default:** `lru_mb = 2048`

### Why It Works

The LRU cache holds recently-used expert weights in VRAM, avoiding PCIe transfers on cache hits. Each expert is ~40 MB, so 2048 MB holds ~50 experts simultaneously.

**Measured impact of LRU size:**

| LRU Size | Gen Speed | Difference from 1024 |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1024 MB | 5.72 tok/s | Baseline |
| 2048 MB | 5.87 tok/s | **+2.6%** |
| 4096 MB | 5.71 tok/s | -0.2% (noise) |

Increasing beyond 2048 MB shows diminishing returns because:
1. GPU compute (not expert transfer) is the bottleneck
2. The expert routing is highly input-dependent — yesterday's hot experts aren't today's
3. More LRU means less VRAM for KV cache context

### When to Diverge

| Scenario | Recommended LRU | Reason |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Short context (< 32K) | 4096 MB | More VRAM available, more expert caching |
| Max context (> 500K) | 1024 MB | Free VRAM for KV cache |
| Different GPU (more VRAM) | 4096-6144 MB | Proportional to VRAM budget |

---

## 5. KV Cache Quantization — `q4_0`

**Default:** `quant_mode = q4_0`

### Why It Works

Q4_0 compresses each KV cache element from 16 bits (FP16) to 4 bits — a 4× compression with minimal accuracy loss. For a model with 40 layers × 2 KV heads × 256-dim, this reduces per-token KV cost from ~80 KB to ~20 KB (measured: ~5.6 KB/token with additional optimizations).

| Quant | KV Size at 500K | Quality Impact |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| FP16 | ~11.2 GB | Full precision |
| Q8_0 | ~5.6 GB | Negligible loss |
| **Q4_0** | **~2.8 GB** | Minimal (KIVI research) |

### When to Diverge

| Scenario | Recommended Quant | Reason |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Quality-critical work | `f16` | No quantization artifacts |
| Benchmarking perplexity | `f16` | Baseline comparison |
| < 500K context | `q8_0` | Higher quality, still fits VRAM |
| > 500K context | `q4_0` | Required to fit |

---

## 6. Thread Count — `4`

**Default:** `threads = 4`

### Why It Works

The GTX 1070 Ti has 8 CPU cores, but using all 8 for inference introduces thread contention on CUDA API calls, memory allocation, and expert routing synchronization.

**Measured impact:**

| Threads | Gen Speed | vs Baseline |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 4 | 5.87 tok/s | **Best** |
| 8 | 4.21 tok/s | -28% |

### When to Diverge

| Scenario | Recommended Threads | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| CPU-bound model | Match core count | More threads help CPU-bound workloads |
| Batch inference | 4-8 | More threads for parallel batch processing |
| This GPU | 4 | Tuned for this specific setup |

---

## 7. Disk Offload — `off` (optional)

**Flag:** `--disk-offload`

### Why Available

Disk offload replaces the anonymous 10 GB VITRIOL buffer with a file-backed mmap of the GGUF file, reducing system RAM pressure. Pages are shared with the OS page cache and can be evicted under memory pressure.

**Measured impact:**

| Mode | Gen Speed | RAM Used |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Normal | 5.87 tok/s | 12-14 GB |
| Disk offload | 5.06 tok/s | 10-12 GB |

**Tradeoff:** -14% speed for -2 GB RAM savings. Only use if your system is memory-constrained.

### When to Enable

| Scenario | Recommended | Reason |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| 16+ GB RAM | Normal mode | Use the speed |
| 8-12 GB RAM | `--disk-offload` | Avoid OOM kills |
| Running other memory-heavy apps alongside | `--disk-offload` | Free RAM for other processes |

## Putting It All Together

### Recommended Command
```bash
vitriol serve --detach -lru 2048 -c 500000 --kv-quant q4_0
```

### Config File (`~/.vitriol/config`)
```ini
[model]
context = 500000
threads = 4
ngl = 99

[vitriol]
mode = stream
lru_mb = 2048

[kv]
mode = offload
quant_mode = q4_0
frozen_prompt = on
```

### For Max Context (1M tokens)
```bash
vitriol serve --detach -lru 1024 -c 1000000 --kv-quant q4_0
```
VRAM at 1M context: ~8.0 GB (tight but fits on 8 GB card).
